# Mira Controlled Vocabulary

This file is the canonical vocabulary source for Mira research state and action fields.

Human-readable explanation can be written in `basis`, `notes`, `risk`, `required_followup` or prose sections. Machine-facing fields should use the tokens below so outputs can be aggregated across cases, memory and PM registers.

## Thesis State

Use in `thesis-ledger.md`, `event-delta.md`, portfolio registers and [memory/research/INDEX.md](../memory/research/INDEX.md).

- `draft`: first-pass research; evidence chain incomplete.
- `active`: evidence trail, refresh condition and disconfirming path are present.
- `watch`: directional view exists, but evidence is not strong enough for active thesis.
- `upgrade_watch`: new evidence is strengthening the thesis, pending confirmation.
- `downgrade_watch`: new evidence weakens the thesis, but does not yet retire it.
- `narrative_watch`: narrative/catalyst exists, but evidence quality is weak or market-pricing-led.
- `stale`: past refresh boundary or event boundary; must refresh before live use.
- `retired`: core assumption was falsified or object left coverage scope.

## Research Action / Decision Type

Use the same token set for `research_action` and `decision_type`.

- `watch_only`: keep on research watchlist; no stronger actionability.
- `upgrade_watch`: increase research priority after confirming evidence.
- `downgrade_watch`: reduce research priority after weakening evidence.
- `add_to_research_queue`: add to future research queue.
- `reduce_research_priority`: deprioritize without retiring.
- `hedge_context`: record as risk or hedge context for a broader book.
- `event_setup`: prepare for an upcoming event delta.
- `post_event_follow_through`: follow up after event delta.
- `valuation_reset_watch`: monitor for valuation or multiple reset.
- `risk_reduction_context`: record as risk-reduction context only.
- `needs_refresh`: conclusion is stale or source-gapped before live use.
- `no_action`: no research action beyond recordkeeping.
- `retire_thesis`: retire the thesis.

## Setup Type

Use in `actionability-bridge.md`.

- `watch_only`
- `upgrade_watch`
- `event_setup`
- `post_event_follow_through`
- `valuation_reset_watch`
- `risk_reduction_context`
- `needs_refresh`
- `no_action`

## Position Sizing Implication

Research-only qualitative sizing language. These are not trade instructions.

- `not_applicable`
- `watchlist_only`
- `small_if_confirmed`
- `normal_only_after_confirmation`
- `reduce_risk_context`

## Strategic Data Dependency

Institutional expectation work is constrained without reliable consensus and estimate data.

When Mira cannot access a consensus/estimate source, write `source_gap` in the relevant variable and avoid pretending that price action, media narrative or company guidance is the same as sell-side consensus.

Strategic data candidates:

- sell-side consensus revenue, EPS, margin and target-price estimates
- estimate revision history
- segment-level consensus where available
- options-implied move and skew data
- institutional ownership / positioning and short interest

## Evidence And Calculation Gap Tokens

Use these tokens in notes, expectation maps, delivery checks and gate outputs when a conclusion cannot be fully supported.

- `source_gap`: required source is missing, stale, inaccessible or below the evidence quality needed for the conclusion.
- `calculation_gap`: required calculation, formula, peer comparison, time-series check or numeric cross-check is missing or not reproducible.
- `calculation_waived_by_speed`: user accepted a faster read without full calculation; related conclusions must remain preliminary.
- `verified_calculation`: derived number has a recorded formula, upstream sources and calculation ledger or explicit formula note.

## Language Field

Formal outputs may include `output_language`.

Recommended values:

- `zh-CN`: Chinese output.
- `en`: English output.
- `mixed`: intentionally bilingual or case-source-driven output.

Default rule: use the user's language for new outputs unless the source package or target audience requires otherwise.
