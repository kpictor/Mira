# Mira Controlled Vocabulary

This file is the canonical vocabulary source for Mira research state and action fields.

Human-readable explanation can be written in `basis`, `notes`, `risk`, `required_followup` or prose sections. Machine-facing fields should use the tokens below so outputs can be aggregated across cases, memory and PM registers.

## Interaction Mode

Use in routing intake (analysis-routing Step 0).

- `quick_answer`: user wants a one-line direction or fact; no full package.
- `routed_research`: normal entry into a routed loop / skill.
- `decision_support`: near actionability / position / portfolio; must run the decision pressure gate (Step 0.5).
- `routing_unclear`: research object or time boundary is fully unclear; clarify definition only.

## Decision Pressure And Framing Risk

Use in routing intake (analysis-routing Step 0.5). These are transient, per-turn routing signals. They describe the structure of the question, not the user's psychology, and must never be written to preference memory or private state.

`decision_pressure`:

- `none`
- `low`
- `medium`
- `high`

`framing_risk` (describe the question structure, not the user):

- `confirmation_seeking`: question is shaped to confirm an existing view.
- `fomo`: question is driven by a recent move or fear of missing it.
- `anchoring`: question anchors on a prior price, cost basis or target.
- `loss_aversion`: question is shaped around avoiding a realized loss.
- `position_defense`: question is shaped to justify keeping an existing exposure.
- `none`

`disconfirmation_required`:

- `yes`
- `no`

## Routing Carryover

Use in routing intake (analysis-routing Step 3.2). Carryover is valid within a single session only; cross-session continuity must go through view-continuity-loop or private state.

`routing_carryover`:

- `none`
- `inherit`
- `reset`

Carryover whitelist (may inherit within a session): `market_scope`, `time_boundary`, `research_object`, `depth_mode`, `output_language`.

Never inherit: `decision_pressure`, `framing_risk`, `disconfirmation_required`, or any inferred user motive.

## Information Value And Knowability

Use in routing intake (analysis-routing Step 3.3), after `depth_mode` is selected. This gate can override the depth choice downward.

`information_value`:

- `low`: another research round is unlikely to change the conclusion or decision.
- `medium`: more research would sharpen but not flip the conclusion.
- `high`: more research can change the conclusion or the decision at stake.

`knowability_status`:

- `knowable`: key variables can be settled with available sources or reasonable research.
- `partially_knowable`: some variables are knowable; core uncertainty remains.
- `unknowable_now`: key variables cannot be known yet; awaits an event, disclosure or time.
- `irreducible_uncertainty`: the conclusion is dominated by an inherently unknowable variable; deeper research will not improve quality. A legitimate honest terminal — pair with `watch_only` / `needs_refresh` and an observable refresh trigger.

`depth_override_reason`: free-text basis when this gate changes the depth selected in Step 3.25.

## Data / Tool Ingestion

Use in analysis-routing Step 3.4 and ingestion artifacts. These tokens describe
how new material enters Mira before it becomes evidence or calculation input.

`ingestion_route`:

- `public_on_demand`: public API or public page read for a specific task.
- `user_material`: user-provided files, notes, models, screenshots,
  transcripts or exported tables.
- `authorized_provider`: licensed third-party provider or institution-approved
  connector.
- `portfolio_private`: holdings, weights, risk reports, mandates or
  constraints provided by the user.
- `derived_dataset`: retained normalized table, peer table, model output or
  scenario dataset created by Mira or a researcher.
- `none`: no new retained material or dataset enters the workflow.

`ingestion_artifacts`:

- `dataset_manifest`
- `user_material_intake`
- `restricted_source_note`
- `connector_registry`
- `field_map`
- `ingestion_log`
- `waived`

`source_registry_action`:

- `reuse`: existing source record is sufficient.
- `case_local_note`: use an explicit case-local source note.
- `add_source`: add or propose a source registry row.
- `waive`: no retained source record is needed because the material was not
  used for evidence or calculation.

`storage_scope`:

- `tracked_allowed`: may be committed to tracked Mira files.
- `private`: keep under gitignored private state.
- `transient_only`: do not retain raw material after the task.

`redistribution_allowed`:

- `yes`
- `no`
- `derived_only`
- `unknown`

## Judgment Confidence

Use at the delivery layer for any material judgment (see MIRA.md Required Output Discipline and the delivery checklist). These are calibrated bands, not pseudo-precise probabilities.

`judgment_confidence`:

- `low`: directional lean only; evidence is thin or conflicting.
- `medium`: supported by evidence but with material open variables.
- `high`: multiple high-weight, cross-checked claims support it.

Companion fields:

- `confidence_basis`: the evidence and reasoning the band rests on.
- `base_rate_anchor`: the reference class or base rate the judgment is anchored against, when applicable.
- `reversal_condition`: the evidence that would flip or downgrade the judgment.

`judgment_confidence` is about Mira's confidence in a judgment, not about source verification (`verification_status`) or evidence posture. A judgment that rests mainly on `forecast`, `assumption`, `opinion` or `sentiment` inputs cannot be `high`; downgrade it and state the `reversal_condition`.

## Thesis State

Use in `thesis-ledger.md`, `event-delta.md`, portfolio registers and [memory/research/INDEX.md](../memory/research/INDEX.md).

- `draft`: first-pass research; evidence chain incomplete.
- `active`: evidence trail, refresh condition and disconfirming path are present.
- `watch`: directional view exists, but evidence is not strong enough for active thesis.
- `upgrade_watch`: new evidence is strengthening the thesis, pending confirmation.
- `downgrade_watch`: new evidence weakens the thesis, but does not yet retire it.
- `narrative_watch`: narrative/catalyst exists, but evidence quality is weak or market-pricing-led.
- `stale`: past refresh boundary or event boundary; must refresh before live use.
- `retired`: core assumption was falsified or object left coverage scope.

## Research Action / Decision Type

Use the same token set for `research_action` and `decision_type`.

- `watch_only`: keep on research watchlist; no stronger actionability.
- `upgrade_watch`: increase research priority after confirming evidence.
- `downgrade_watch`: reduce research priority after weakening evidence.
- `add_to_research_queue`: add to future research queue.
- `reduce_research_priority`: deprioritize without retiring.
- `hedge_context`: record as risk or hedge context for a broader book.
- `event_setup`: prepare for an upcoming event delta.
- `post_event_follow_through`: follow up after event delta.
- `valuation_reset_watch`: monitor for valuation or multiple reset.
- `risk_reduction_context`: record as risk-reduction context only.
- `needs_refresh`: conclusion is stale or source-gapped before live use.
- `no_action`: no research action beyond recordkeeping.
- `retire_thesis`: retire the thesis.

## Setup Type

Use in `actionability-bridge.md`.

- `watch_only`
- `upgrade_watch`
- `event_setup`
- `post_event_follow_through`
- `valuation_reset_watch`
- `risk_reduction_context`
- `needs_refresh`
- `no_action`

## Position Sizing Implication

Research-only qualitative sizing language. These are not trade instructions.

- `not_applicable`
- `watchlist_only`
- `small_if_confirmed`
- `normal_only_after_confirmation`
- `reduce_risk_context`

## Position Data Status

Use in position and portfolio review templates before drawing position-level conclusions.

- `no_position_data`: no real holding, weight, cost basis or mandate was provided.
- `partial_position_data`: some position information exists, but key fields are missing.
- `position_data_provided`: user provided enough position context for a position-level review.
- `research_only`: the review is intentionally limited to thesis exposure, not real portfolio holdings.

## Position Review Action

Use in `position-review.md`, `position-register.csv`, portfolio exposure reviews and decision logs when a real or proposed position is discussed. These are review actions, not executed trades.

- `research_only`: return thesis or exposure implications without position-level conclusion.
- `hold_review`: current position remains reviewable if thesis, evidence and refresh conditions still support it.
- `add_only_if_confirmed`: adding exposure would require specified confirming evidence first.
- `trim_review`: position size appears high relative to evidence, risk, stale status or constraints; review risk reduction.
- `exit_review`: thesis or risk evidence is weak enough that an exit review is required.
- `risk_cap_review`: review whether a cap, hedge context or concentration limit is needed.
- `needs_refresh`: thesis, source, valuation or position data is stale or incomplete before stronger review action.
- `no_action`: no position-management implication beyond recordkeeping.

## Position Sizing Context

Use in position and portfolio reviews. These are qualitative context labels, not target weights.

- `not_applicable`
- `watchlist_only`
- `starter_only`
- `normal_if_confirmed`
- `too_large_for_evidence`
- `too_small_for_conviction`

- `listed_option_long_premium`
- `listed_option_spread`
- `protective_option`
- `collar_or_overlay`
- `income_overlay`
- `short_sale`
- `pair_or_relative_value`
- `portfolio_hedge`
- `no_instrument_route`

## Instrument Data Status

Use in instrument strategy gates to explain whether structure-specific data is
usable. Human-readable details belong in `notes`, `basis` or the required-data
table.

- `available`
- `partial`
- `missing`
- `stale`
- `not_applicable`
- `source_gap`

## Portfolio Review Scope

Use when a task discusses multiple holdings or theses.

- `research_book`: thesis/watchlist review only; real position weights are absent.
- `real_portfolio`: holdings, weights or mandate are provided.
- `mixed`: real holdings plus research-only watchlist objects.

## Technical / Market Pricing State

Use in [../templates/technical-analysis-check.csv](../templates/technical-analysis-check.csv) and memo `technical_context` fields.

`trend_state`:

- `uptrend_confirmed`
- `uptrend_extended`
- `range_constructive`
- `range_neutral`

- `source_gap`

Technical state tokens are market-pricing descriptors only. They must not be used as proof of company execution, fundamental quality or long-term thesis durability.

## Top / Bottom Risk Overlay Tokens

Use when `top-bottom-risk` overlay is selected. These labels describe risk state, not trade instructions.

`risk_regime`:

- `trend_confirmation`: fundamentals, expectations and reaction quality still align.
- `fragile_upside`: fundamentals are strong, but price requires continued upside surprise.
- `distribution_risk`: good news fades or relative strength weakens after a large move.
- `capitulation_watch`: downside may be forced or exhausted, but thesis repair is not yet proven.
- `base_building`: bad news is being absorbed and evidence is stabilizing.
- `bear_trap_risk`: weak fundamentals coexist with crowded short exposure or removable left-tail assumptions.
- `no_clear_extreme`: no reliable top / bottom risk state can be assigned.

`fundamental_slope`:

- `accelerating`
- `positive_but_decelerating`
- `stable_high_level`
- `deteriorating`
- `mixed`
- `source_gap`

`expectation_burden`:

- `low`
- `medium`
- `high`
- `extreme`
- `source_gap`

`positioning_liquidity`:

- `needs_confirmation`
- `can_digest`
- `needs_reset`
- `waiting_for_capitulation`
- `source_gap`

## Strategic Data Dependency

Institutional expectation work is constrained without reliable consensus and estimate data.

When Mira cannot access a consensus/estimate source, write `source_gap` in the relevant variable and avoid pretending that price action, media narrative or company guidance is the same as sell-side consensus.

Strategic data candidates:

- sell-side consensus revenue, EPS, margin and target-price estimates
- estimate revision history
- segment-level consensus where available
- options-implied move and skew data
- institutional ownership / positioning and short interest

## Evidence And Calculation Gap Tokens

Use these tokens in notes, expectation maps, delivery checks and gate outputs when a conclusion cannot be fully supported.

- `source_gap`: required source is missing, stale, inaccessible or below the evidence quality needed for the conclusion.
- `calculation_gap`: required calculation, formula, peer comparison, time-series check or numeric cross-check is missing or not reproducible.
- `calculation_waived_by_speed`: user accepted a faster read without full calculation; related conclusions must remain preliminary.
- `verified_calculation`: derived number has a recorded formula, upstream sources and calculation ledger or explicit formula note.

## Language Field

Formal outputs may include `output_language`.

Recommended values:

- `zh-CN`: Chinese output.
- `en`: English output.
- `mixed`: intentionally bilingual or case-source-driven output.

Default rule: use the user's language for new outputs unless the source package or target audience requires otherwise.
